# TypeScript CLI Demo

This is a small demo on how to create a cli application using TypeScript. 

## Getting Started

prerequisite: [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) must be installed onto your computer. 

1. Clone this repository 
2. Navigate to the directory saved on your computer on your terminal. 
3. Execute `npm install` to install all of the project's dependencies. 
4. Run `npm run greet <name>`

### Uninstall CLI Application 
Once you're done using it and no longer would like app on your computer, simply run `npm uninstall greet` in teh file directory and the cli application will be uninstalled from your machine. 

## Final Thoughts
It was an interesting exercise in learning how TypeScript compiles into Javascript with the `npx tsc` command. It also opened made me think how there are different npm packages to add CLI functionality.
